SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
=====================================================

FIXED ISSUES:
1. Removed duplicate customer ID removal logic in controller that was causing valid customers to be hidden
2. Removed duplicate customer ID checking in view that was skipping valid customer rows
3. Fixed empty string filter handling to properly treat empty strings as null
4. Fixed created_by_user_id handling in model to properly allow null values
5. Enhanced debugging throughout create, store, and display flow
6. Simplified customer creation redirect logic

RESULT:
- All created customers should now display correctly
- No customers should disappear when new ones are created
- Deleted customers are completely removed
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
